	  <h4>I'm <strong>{{ site.author }}</strong>, data scientist @ <a href="http://www.github.com">a small social coding startup</a>, former postdoc  @ <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/">CMU</a>, community hacker, and nerd. </h4>
	  <h4>I am an avid scholar of distributed work, particularly open source software development. I'm most interested in what lives at the intersection of digital and physical spaces in software communities. I am actively involved in organizing Free and Open Source community events like the <a href="abstractions.io">Abstractions Conference</a>, <a href="http://www.reddotrubyconf.com/"> Red Dot Ruby Conference</a>, and Ruby meetups. </h4>
	  <h4> I am also interested in how communities acquire norms, how these evolve over time, and what impact they have on community success. Ask me about my PhD work @ <a href="http://nus.edu.sg"> NUS </a> on distributed work, free software and conflict. </h4>
	  <h4>I dabble in Python, R, PHP and Ruby. I heart <a href="http://www.archlinux.org">Arch Linux</a>. In my spare time, I learn new things and barre.</h4>
