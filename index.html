	  <h4>I'm <strong>{{ site.author }}</strong>, postdoc  @ <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/">CMU</a>, community hacker, and nerd.</h4>
	  <h4>I am interested in how communities acquire norms, how these evolve over time, and what impact they have on community success. I also study the role of face-to-face events in supporting distributed community development. Ask me about my PhD work @ <a href="http://nus.edu.sg"> NUS </a> on distributed work, free software and conflict. </h4>
	  <h4>I dabble in data science and front-end development so I grok Python, R, PHP and am enjoying learning Ruby. I heart <a href="http://www.archlinux.org">Arch Linux</a>. In my spare time, I learn new things and dance.</h4>
