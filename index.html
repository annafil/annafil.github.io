	  <h4>I'm <strong>{{ site.author }}</strong>, Director of Community (read: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership">servant leader</a>) at <a href="https://www.getdbt.com">getdbt.com</a>,  former analytics engineering manager @ <a href="http://www.github.com">a small social coding startup</a>, former postdoc  @ <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/">CMU</a>, community hacker, and nerd. </h4>
	  <h4>I <strike>write</strike> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yGZ0e6oAAAAJ&hl=en">nerd out</a> about all kinds of distributed work, particularly communities developed around open source software. I'm most interested in learning everything I can about growing healthy, engaging and supportive technical communities. I enjoy organizing community events like <a href="http://www.abstractions.io">Abstractions</a>, the <a href="http://www.reddotrubyconf.com/">Red Dot Ruby Conference</a>, and Ruby meetups. </h4>
	  <h4>I am also interested in how communities acquire their norms, how these evolve over time, and what impact they have on community success. Ask me about my PhD work @ <a href="http://nus.edu.sg"> NUS </a> on free and open source software and conflict. </h4>
	  <h4>I dabble in SQL, Python, R, PHP and Ruby. I heart Arch Linux. In my spare time, I learn new things and barre.</h4>
