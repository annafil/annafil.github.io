    			My dissertation research looks at the social dynamics of FOSS systems, charting how projects work, and how they work through collaboration challenges. Armed with perspectives from communications, organizational behavior and social psychology, the research digs into conflicts to find out what makes and breaks working together online. The work hopes to improve the experience of both FOSS projects and organisations that rely on remote work.
    		</p>
    		<p>
    			I am also interested in other social computing challenges, such as growing software communities through community code engagements and unpacking the paradox between privacy and personal information disclosure on social media.
